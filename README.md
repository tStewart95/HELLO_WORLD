Travis Stewart

Hello, my name is Travis Stewart. I am a sophomore computer science major at Auburn university.
I have experience in java and javascript. I try to learn one new thing related to programming every day.
I started as a pre-med student but I realized that problem solving was not something I coulde use to study the material for my classes, or use on the tests I was taking. Problem solving has always been something I've enjoyed doing and programming scratches that itch for me.

Using github, I plan on contributing to open-source projects and learning as much as I can on my own.
