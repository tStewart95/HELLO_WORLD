Travis Stewart

Hello, my name is Travis Stewart. I am a sophomore computer science major at Auburn university.
I have experience in java and javascript. I try to learn one new thing related to programming every day.

Using github, I plan on contributing to open-source projects and learning as much as I can on my own.
